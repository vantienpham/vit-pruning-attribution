# The build to force after the lockfile install, and where to get it. Leave both
# empty to skip step 3 entirely (correct when the cluster has one driver
# generation, or when the lockfile already resolves something that runs
# everywhere).
#
# Pick the value from the OLDEST architecture you intend to schedule on, not the
# newest -- a wheel built for newer GPUs fails on older nodes, so jobs silently
# queue only for the newest partitions, or crash after queueing.
#
# Find the right value by checking the oldest driver you intend to use:
#   sinfo -o '%P %N'
#   srun -p <oldest-partition> nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv
#
# Why THIS value on THIS cluster (measured 2026-08-11, full argument in
# cluster.local.md): the P5000 and V100 nodes run driver 560.35.05, whose CUDA
# ceiling is 12.6, while the A100 nodes run 590.44.01. An unconstrained `uv sync`
# resolves a +cu130 torch, which fails on the 560 nodes twice over -- the driver
# is below CUDA 13's minimum of 580, and CUDA 13 ships no sm_61/sm_70 cubins at
# all. It succeeds on A100 and newer, so the breakage looks like bad nodes rather
# than a bad wheel. cu124 over cu126: both clear the ceiling, but 12.6 wants
# driver >=560.28.03 against a measured 560.35.05 -- 0.07 of margin. cu124 needs
# only >=525 and still covers sm_60/61/70 through sm_90, so one build serves
# every partition.
#
# VERIFY, do not assume -- step 8 below tells you how.

This ran on the LOGIN node. It has not proven the build runs on a GPU, and
`torch.cuda.is_available()` above is not that proof -- it returns True on a wheel
that carries no cubin for the device, and the failure only surfaces at kernel
launch. Verify on the OLDEST architecture you intend to schedule on:

Compute nodes have no outbound internet on this cluster. Warm the caches here,
on the login node, before submitting anything:

From here on, always launch with 'uv run --no-sync'.
